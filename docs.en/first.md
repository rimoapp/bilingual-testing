### Diarization during Note Upload
The "Speaker Extraction during Note Upload" mentioned above is performed, and participants are assigned to the note, upon which speaker separation takes place. Essentially, speaker separation is performed based on the corresponding participants, and speakers are assigned to each segment.

Additionally, there is a feature that outputs any unregistered speech as "Unassigned." The speaker separation API can receive information about speakers along with `speaker_num_hint: int`. If the number indicated by speaker_num_hint is greater than the actual number of speakers, it will output "Unassigned (1)," "Unassigned (2)," etc., indicating "unknown speakers separated as unassigned." Conversely, if the number of speakers matches the speaker_num_hint, it will not output any unassigned speakers.
